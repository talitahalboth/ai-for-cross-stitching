# ai-for-cross-stitching

Tries to find the most optimized path for cross stitching.

This uses an genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem, modified so that it is not necessary to go back to the starting point.

## Genetic Algorithm

### Parent Selection

For the parent selection we do the tournament selection.

### Crossover

The crossover is carried out using the EAX (edge assembly crossover algorithm).
